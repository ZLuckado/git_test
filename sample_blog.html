    <h1> Toads are a menace</h1>
    <h2> The Problem </h2>
    <p> To understand the reasoning for toad extinction, one must <em> truly</em> experience the evils of their species. </p>
    <p> Not only are they <strong> godless heathens</strong>, they are also prone to drug use. </p> 
    <p> This problem has gone unmentioned and frankly ignored by the powers that be, while the lower rungs of society <strong><em>suffer</em></strong> at the tongues of this amphibious menace. </p>
    
    <h2> Why exactly are toads so troublesome? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> They are ubiquitous </li>
        <li> They carry diseases (we think) </li>
        <li> They contribute nothing to the good fight. </li>
        <li> They eat all of the tastiest insects </li>     
    </ul>
    <h2> So what are we to do? </h2>
    <p> We must petiton our governments to allocate funding for the eradication of these <strong> banes of human existence </strong>. </p>
    
    <h2> What steps must we take to inact change? </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> First we must prepare individually for the coming invasion. This is the most important step, in case none of the others are successful. </li>
        <li> We must write an open letter to the leaders of all world governments demanding their assistance. </li>
        <li> We must then organize marches in the capitals of these countries to show our <strong> determination </strong> and our <strong> strength of numbers</strong>. Only this will instill fear and show them the seriousness of this issue.</li>
        
    </ol>
